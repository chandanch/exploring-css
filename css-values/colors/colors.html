            HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)
            are two alternative representations of the RGB color model, designed
            in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align
            with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes

                PowerShell (including Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core)
                is a task automation and configuration management framework
                from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and
                associated scripting language built
                on the .NET Framework and .NET Core.
            </p>

                In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed by
                cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes
                implementing a particular operation.
            </p>

                PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators
                to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows
                systems as well as WS-Management and CIM enabling management of
                remote Linux systems and network devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the PowerShell
                runtime can be embedded inside other applications

                PowerShell includes its own extensive, console-based help
                (similar to man pages in Unix shells) accessible via the Get-Help cmdlet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Local help contents can be retrieved from the Internet via Update-Help cmdlet.
