                PowerShell (including Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core)
                is a task automation and configuration management framework
                from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and
                associated scripting language built
                on the .NET Framework and .NET Core.

                In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed by
                cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes
                implementing a particular operation.
