                In digital imaging, a pixel, pel,[1] dots, or picture element
                is a physical point in a raster image, or the smallest
                addressable element in an all points addressable display
                device; so it is the smallest controllable element of a
                picture represented on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The address of a pixel corresponds to its physical coordinates.
                LCD pixels are manufactured in a two-dimensional grid, and are
                often represented using dots or
                squares, but CRT pixels correspond to their timing mechanisms .
            </p>
            <p>
                Each pixel is a sample of an original image; more samples
                typically provide more accurate representations of the original.
                The intensity of each pixel is variable. In color imaging systems,
                a color is typically represented by three or four component intensities
                such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

                    In some contexts (such as descriptions of camera sensors),
                    the term pixel is used to refer to a single scalar element
                    of a multi-component representation (more precisely called a
                    photosite in the camera sensor context, although the neologism
                    sensel is sometimes used to describe the elements of a digital
                    camera's sensor)

                A key frame in animation and filmmaking is a drawing that
                defines the starting and ending points of any smooth transition.
                The drawings are called "frames" because their position in time is
                measured in frames on a strip of film.
                A sequence of key frames defines which movement
                the viewer will see, whereas the position of the key
                frames on the film, video, or animation defines the timing o
                f the movement. Because only two or three key frames over the
                span of a second do not create the illusion of movement,
                the remaining frames are filled with inbetweens.

                According to the Talmud, Solomon is one of the 48 prophets.
                In the Quran, he is considered a major prophet,
                and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic
                variant Sulayman, son of David.
                The Hebrew Bible credits him as the builder of the First Temple in
                Jerusalem, beginning
                in the fourth year of his reign,
                using the vast wealth he had accumulated.
