                In digital imaging, a pixel, pel,[1] dots, or picture element
                is a physical point in a raster image, or the smallest
                addressable element in an all points addressable display
                device; so it is the smallest controllable element of a
                picture represented on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The address of a pixel corresponds to its physical coordinates.
                LCD pixels are manufactured in a two-dimensional grid, and are
                often represented using dots or
                squares, but CRT pixels correspond to their timing mechanisms .
            </p>
            <p>
                Each pixel is a sample of an original image; more samples
                typically provide more accurate representations of the original.
                The intensity of each pixel is variable. In color imaging systems,
                a color is typically represented by three or four component intensities
                such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

                    In some contexts (such as descriptions of camera sensors),
                    the term pixel is used to refer to a single scalar element
                    of a multi-component representation (more precisely called a
                    photosite in the camera sensor context, although the neologism
                    sensel is sometimes used to describe the elements of a digital
                    camera's sensor)
