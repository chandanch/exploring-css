                <h2>A short story</h2>
                <p>
                    The crystal skulls are human skull hardstone carvings made of clear
                    or milky white quartz (also called "rock crystal"),
                    claimed to be pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artifacts by their alleged finders;
                    however, these claims have been refuted for all of the specimens made
                    available for scientific studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of these studies demonstrated that those
                    examined were manufactured in the mid-19th
                    century or later, almost certainly in Europe during a time when interest in ancient
                    culture was abundant. Despite some claims presented in an assortment of
                    popularizing literature, legends of crystal skulls with mystical powers do not
                    figure in genuine Mesoamerican or other Native American
                    mythologies and spiritual accounts.
