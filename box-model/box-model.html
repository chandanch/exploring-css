        <h2>Salvador Dalí</h2>

        <h4>Overflow visible</h4>

            Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, Marquis of Dalí de Púbol
            (11 May 1904 – 23 January 1989),was a prominent Spanish surrealist
            artist of Catalan ethnicity born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain.
            This name uses Spanish naming customs: the first or paternal family
            name is Dalí and the second or maternal family name is Domènech.

            Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre
            images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are
            often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters.
            His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in
            August 1931. Dalí's expansive artistic repertoire included film,
            sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in
            a variety of media.

            Dalí attributed his "love of everything that is gilded and excessive,
            my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes"
            to an "Arab lineage", claiming that his ancestors were descended from the Moors.
            Dalí was highly imaginative, and also enjoyed indulging in unusual and
            grandiose behavior.
            His eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes
            drew more attention than his artwork, to the dismay of those who held his
            work in high esteem, and to the irritation of his critics.

            Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech was born on 11 May 1904, at 8:45 am GMT,
            on the first floor of Carrer Monturiol, 20 (presently 6),
            in the town of Figueres, in the Empordà region, close to the French border
            in Catalonia, Spain. In the Summer of 1912, the family moved to the top floor of
            Carrer Monturiol 24 (presently 10). Dalí's older brother, who had also been
            named Salvador (born 12 October 1901), had died of gastroenteritis nine months earlier,
            on 1 August 1903. His father, Salvador Dalí i Cusí, was a middle-class lawyer
            and notary whose strict disciplinary approach was tempered by his wife,
            Felipa Domenech Ferrés, who encouraged her son's artistic endeavors.

                When he was five, Dalí was taken to his brother's grave and told by his parents
                that he was his brother's reincarnation, a concept which he came to
                believe. <span class="display-block">Of his brother, Dalí said, "[we] resembled each other like two
                drops of water, but we had different reflections.</span>

                Dalí also had a sister, Anna Maria, who was three years younger. In 1949, she published a book about her brother, Dalí As Seen By His Sister.
