        <h2>Salvador Dalí</h2>


        <div class="overflow-visible">

            Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, Marquis of Dalí de Púbol
            (11 May 1904 – 23 January 1989),was a prominent Spanish surrealist
            artist of Catalan ethnicity born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain.
            This name uses Spanish naming customs: the first or paternal family
            name is Dalí and the second or maternal family name is Domènech.

            Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre
            images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are
            often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters.
            His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in
            August 1931. Dalí's expansive artistic repertoire included film,
            sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in
            a variety of media.

            Dalí attributed his "love of everything that is gilded and excessive,
            my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes"
            to an "Arab lineage", claiming that his ancestors were descended from the Moors.
            Dalí was highly imaginative, and also enjoyed indulging in unusual and
            grandiose behavior.
            His eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes
            drew more attention than his artwork, to the dismay of those who held his
            work in high esteem, and to the irritation of his critics.
