            The barracuda is a ray-finned fish known for its large size,
            fearsome appearance and ferocious behaviour. The barracuda is a
            saltwater fish of the genus Sphyraena, the only genus in the family
            Sphyraenidae which was named by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.
