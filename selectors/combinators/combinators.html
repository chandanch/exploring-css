                Petroleum jelly, petrolatum, white petrolatum, soft paraffin/paraffin wax
                or multi-hydrocarbon, CAS number 8009-03-8, is a semi-solid mixture of
                hydrocarbons (with carbon numbers mainly higher than 25)

                After petroleum jelly became a medicine chest staple, consumers
                began to use it for many ailments as well as cosmetic purposes.
                Its folkloric medicinal value as a "cure-all" has since been limited by
                better scientific understanding of appropriate and inappropriate uses
            </p>

                        Most petroleum jelly today is used as an ingredient in skin
                        lotions and cosmetics, providing various types of skin care and protection
                        by minimizing friction or reducing moisture loss, or by functioning as a
