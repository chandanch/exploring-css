        <h2>Quartz</h2>
        <p>
            Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms in a continuous framework
            of SiO4 siliconâ€“oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two
            tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2. Quartz is the second
            most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, behind feldspar
