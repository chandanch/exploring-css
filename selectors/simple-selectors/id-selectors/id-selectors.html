        <p id="introduction">
            Pure quartz, traditionally called rock crystal or clear quartz,
            is colorless and transparent or translucent, and has often been
            used for hardstone carvings, such as the Lothair Crystal.
        </p>
        <p id="variants">
            The most important distinction between types of
            quartz is that of macrocrystalline
            (individual crystals visible to the unaided eye) and the microcrystalline or
            cryptocrystalline varieties (aggregates of crystals visible only under
            high magnification).
