        <p class="first-paragraph mark-paragraph">
            Quartz belongs to the trigonal crystal system. The ideal crystal shape
            is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramids at each end.
        </p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
            In nature quartz crystals
            are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or
            so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part
            of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph mark-paragraph">
            Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained
            growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached at the
            other end to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present.
            However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop
            freely without attachment, for instance within gypsum.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            α-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, space group
            P3121 or P3221 depending on the chirality. β-quartz belongs to the
            hexagonal system, space group P6222 and P6422, respectively.
